# 🏛️ ARCHSTIL | History of Architectural Styles


## About the project
Recreating Netflix's initial interface, where I bring my version about Architectural Styles. Project developed for learning purposes in the [Digital Innovation One course](https://www.dio.me/).

## Why ArchStil?
**Arch:** Architecture
**Stil:** Style in German

Knowing that Netflix is the junction between “Net” and “Flix” (Flicks), as the purpose of my proposal was to talk about architectural styles, I chose to make the junction of “Arch” (Architecture) and “Stil” (Style in German) . The choice to adopt a German word was inspired by the name of the Bauhaus.
