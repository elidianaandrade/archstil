# ARCHSTIL | History of Architectural Styles

## 🏛️ About the project
Recreating [Netflix's](https://www.netflix.com/) initial interface, where I bring my version about Architectural Styles. This project was developed for learning purposes in the course of the [Digital Innovation One](https://www.dio.me/).

### Why ArchStil?
**Arch:** Architecture. **Stil:** Style in German

Knowing that [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) is the junction between “Net” and “Flix” (Flicks), as the purpose of my proposal was to talk about architectural styles, I chose to make the junction of “Arch” (Architecture) and “Stil” (Style in German) . The choice to adopt a German word was inspired by the name of the Bauhaus.
